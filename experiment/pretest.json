It means that if the user does not provide a value for "b" when calling the function, it will default to 2. The argument "a" does not have a default value, making it a required argument. However, this option includes a default argument, so it is not an example of a required argument.",

Inside the function, the kwargs parameter becomes a dictionary containing the passed keyword arguments.",

Required arguments are those that do not have a default value assigned to them. Therefore, it is mandatory to provide a value for these arguments when calling the function. If a required argument is not provided, Python will raise a TypeError and inform you that the function call is missing a required positional argument.",
                          "b": "This option is incorrect because it refers to the behavior of default arguments, not required arguments. Default arguments are used when a value is not provided explicitly when calling a function. They have a predefined default value assigned to them, which is used if no value is provided. Required arguments, on the other hand, do not have a default value and must be provided by the caller.",
                          "c": "This option is incorrect because it suggests that the function will use the last provided argument as a substitute for the missing required argument. In Python, arguments are matched based on their position, so the function will expect the arguments to be provided in the correct order.
